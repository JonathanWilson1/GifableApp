<p>Social distancing has been around for many months now and will have a lasting effect on the people that have lived through the experience. Many restaurants will have to carry through measures for the coming years. Are food trucks uniquely placed to thrive in such an environment?</p>

<br>
<h2>Goals of Social Distancing</h2>
<br>

<p>Contact and air droplets are the main transmission medium of the Covid 19 virus. To reduce the risk of contracting the virus, we are mainly advised to maintain at least 2 meters distance. Additionally, avoiding contact with others or surfaces others have touched.</p>

<p>You may realise that this is a nearly unmanageable process when running a busy restaurant. Chefs and staff come into contact with each other, utensils, plates, and surfaces thousands of times during the day. Almost zero kitchens would allow staff to maintain a 2 meters distance while maintaining a fully functional cooking process.</p>

<br>
<h2>Food Truck Benefits</h2>
<br>

<p>Food trucks generally have a small team and limited menu, it is possible to maintain the entire kitchen under one chef. Support could also be provided in terms of preparation at a distance, possibly at a satellite kitchen or distanced prepping area outside the truck.</p>

<br>

<p>The premises of a food truck is situated in a public area, the limitation to many restaurants is being able to effectively space out customers to meet the two meters distance. Customers have the ability to place orders at the point of sale and maintain distance until called to collect their order, one at a time. This could also be automated with a text based method of maintaining orders or a ticketing board visible at a distance.</p>

<br>
<h2>How Can Restaurants Cope</h2>
<br>

<p>Restaurants are going to be some of the hardest hit businesses with the lockdown measures and they will likely be waiting with baited breath for their relaxations. In the meantime efforts will need to be made to reduce contact between staff and customers. Personal protective equipment will be a must for many years to come, in the form of masks and gloves.</p>

<p>The flow of customers will need to be carefully managed and the seating arranged to provide space between each table and person. Extra cleaning will be needed between services and the kitchen staff must maintain their own equipment.</p>

<p>Possibly, restaurants will think about transitioning to a delivery only service known as a <a href="/blog/what-is-a-cloud-kitchen">Cloud Kitchen</a>. Giving them the ability to remove the interaction with customers entirely, leaving their food at the doorstep and taking two steps back.</p>

<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<br>

<p>Social distancing and maintaining a restaurant is an unattainable dream for many. Providing the best possible changes to enable your customers safety will provide reassurance and a more relaxing experience. Visibly portraying your attempts to keep everyone safe will be a priority for a high functioning restaurant for the foreseeable future. </p>

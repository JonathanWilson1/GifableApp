<p>Like it or not 2020 technology trends will be shaped by the Covid 19 virus and the processes in place to prevent its spread. This year you can expect delivery apps, robotics, take home alternatives, and contactless payments to be at the top of this year's innovations.</p>

<br>
<h2>Robotics</h2>
<br>

<p>This year's <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51003084">CES conference</a> has already showcased a number of innovations in the robotics world specifically designed to aid in restaurants. The new BellaBot can run for 24 hours delivering plates to tables in your restaurant. It is capable of carrying 4 plates at a time at 22 pounds each.</p>

<p>Every year you may see new bots just like this and every year they are slightly better than their predecessors. We still see them as too niche in their skills to compete with a human server, especially in a busy restaurant. If you wanted a reliable kitchen to table delivery system we would suggest a sushi conveyor belt to distribute your food. It may have some <a target="\_blank" href="https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/why-revolving-conveyor-belt-sushi-is-fading-in-japan-5f3bd70adc34">flaws</a> but it is a tried and tested method that could hold up to the social distancing standards of the future.</p>

<p>Some kitchens may even benefit from the repeated tasks being automated by the popular <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.iaasiaonline.com/controlling-robotic-arms-2/">robotic arm</a> which is prevalent in car manufacturing. In the past they have been too slow to compete with a dedicated chef, but are they finally coming to light as a solution? Some kitchens will fare better than others, pizzas and burgers for example may well be easier automated than stir frys.</p>

<br>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<br>

<p>As with most businesses in 2020 the top priority is limiting contact between customers and staff. The worry of spreading the virus has led to a 40% uptake in contactless payments and the World Health Organisation <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35384/who-urges-switch-to-contactless-to-slow-virus-transmission">recommending</a> contactless card payments as a solution going forward. Many had already adopted the trend before the virus with the addition of contactless payments in mobile phones, the virus will certainly speed the change in culture to prefer this by years.</p>

<p>Delivery and online ordering are also on the up, which will benefit online payment companies such as Paypal and Apple. A restaurant will need to be prepared to take any payment method available to prosper in the new age of digital exchanges. The days of a cash only restaurant are numbered. Many of these will be supplied by your online ordering provider but it will be up to the owner to ensure they are meeting every customer's need, if they want to pay by Paypal then you better support it.</p>

<br>
<h2>Delivery</h2>
<br>

<p>A majority of the world has now seen some form of lock down, delivery and online ordering have been a way to maintain restaurants during these times. With the lockdowns likely to affect restaurants for many more months due to the inability to maintain social distancing, delivery is likely to be a big winner in the eyes of their owners.</p>

<br>

<p>Many apps already exist to enable restaurants to bring in delivery orders, and being able to capitalize in this trend will be a key goal for many. Delivery propagation services, which amalgamate all the apps into one will be a trend going forward. This will limit the work needed to maintain many different processes and websites at once.</p>

<br>
<h2>Take Home Alternatives</h2>
<br>

<p>Lock down has led to more takeaway orders but the boredom of locked in life leads to customers wanting more variety. Companies like <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.cookfood.net/">Cook Food</a> deliver ready made meals but there is nothing stopping restaurants providing their meals in a pre-cooked or pre-prepared format, which may well survive the delivery process better.</p>

<br>

<p>As an example, the kitchen may prepare all the ingredients freshly for a customer's usual delivery meal. Rather than cooking and sending, they package it into individually boxed steps along with the recipe so they can prepare at home. They lose the convenience of the cooked meal but gain in an experience, adding social value to an otherwise simple transaction, with the ability to speak of their involvement.</p>

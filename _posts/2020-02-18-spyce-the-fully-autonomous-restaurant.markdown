<p>The dream of a fully autonomous restaurant has been a reality since 2015 by <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.spyce.com">Spyce</a> in Bosten. They are able to take healthy vegetable based bowls and create them using a completely automated system. <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.spyce.com">Spyce</a> was founded by Michael Farid, Kale Rogers, Luke Schlueter &amp; Brady Knight, four really hungry MIT students and water polo teammates who were tired of spending $10 on take-out lunches and dinners.</p>

<p>The system allows customers to order directly from their bank of apps and watch as their meal is prepared in front of their eyes in a series of spinning pots. They focus on Lebanese, Indian, Thai, or Korean bowls and are all created by the robots. The final touch is placed by their garde manger, and there is a support staff to watch over the workings and interact with customers.</p>

<p>After receiving a $21 million series A funding round they are opening a new store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Binging the same great automation and style as they have proved in Boston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really excited to be moving to Cambridge,&rdquo; said Rogers COO. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s always been very near and dear to our hearts, going to school there. We think that the area provides a great opportunity&#8230;to bring our healthy, tasty meals to more people, and to do so in an environment that allows a lot of people to experience a little more time with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You have a great restaurant but not many people know it even exists, you need to let the right people know about your food, experiences and culture. How can you take advantage of the digital marketing trends of 2020.</p>

<p>Simply put digital marketing is using the internet to get your content in front of the eyes of people that are most likely to purchase from you. Gone are the days when you would spend thousands on radio, billboard, and tv campaigns and potentially waste money on views from people that will never buy from you.</p>

<br>
<h2>1. Fine tune your digital front of house</h2>
<br>

<p>Before you start any digital marketing you need to make sure your digital storefront is as good as it can be. This is usually in the form of a website but all touch points from your customers need to be top notch too. I.e. social media accounts, Google my Business listings and delivery provider profiles.</p>

<p>To improve these you should have a great logo, company name, and have all details up to date and relevant. A consistent brand is something that should be worked upon the entire life of a restaurant. A website needs to be responsive, as in it will look nice on mobile phones. Beyond that the site should be clear in what it needs to achieve, usually this will be to notify the customer about your brand, opening times, and delivery options.</p>

<p>Make sure your location is correct and verified on Google my Business so that you can be found via google maps. You will usually receive a verification code in the post. Ensure details are up to date such as opening hours and contact details. There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than driving to a restaurant listed as open on Google Maps to find it shut. You might even land a bad review from someone who didn&rsquo;t even make it through the door, not a great start.</p>

<p>Your social channels are also a huge part of your brand and they should be as up to date as everything else. An actively engaged social following will only be achieved if your customers can see value in using these platforms.</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Stay Consistent</h2>
<br>

<p>Social channels like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, etc need regular updates and content that makes people want to come to your restaurant or share the experience with others.</p>

<p>To effectively take advantage of more platforms you should look into a solution like <a target="\_blank" href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a>, which will let you post once and send to every site. They will also let you schedule posts so you can spend less busy periods to sort out the week's posts.</p>

<br>
<h2>3. Create Engaging Content</h2>
<br>

<p>What should you be posting then? You have a great website, all your social channels are on point in terms of brand and information, and you post regularly.</p>

<br>

<ul class="list-group">

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Reviews</b>, the main indication to customers of a great restaurant is its reviews. To maintain a high star rating you need to be making sure that people who enjoy the experience have ample opportunity to post publicly their thoughts. Alongside this you should be acting on bad reviews and suggestions actively. Where possible respond to all reviews, and share positive reviews on your social channels.</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Images</b>, You constantly produce great tasting and great looking food. Let everyone know about it with a great picture. Sites like Instagram are mostly about the images but others do well too. Having photos of each of your dishes lets customers make more informed decisions about visiting your restaurant and what they may like to order. Variations, Specials, One offs and your staples should all have lots of photos posted, showing consistency and flare with each addition.</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Menu Updates</b>, having a seasonal menu can keep things fresh and take advantage of discount produce. Make sure you have all your menus easily accessible online, as well as regularly posting any changes your customers may appreciate.</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Events</b>, parties, birthdays, celebrations are all big and small occurrences in a restaurant. Try and capture the atmosphere with a picture or video to post on your channels. If you have a planned event, try creating a story around it. Videos of preparation, arrival, during, and after all make good content.</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Competitions</b>, start a buzz around an interesting competition. Make sure you gain a benefit from it by asking people to both share, like, and comment posts to enter. The prize should be a voucher or free meal.</li>

<li class="list-group-item"><b>Offers</b>, offers pull in customers that are on the fence. Make them interesting, enticing and regular. One off big weekends or quiet time promotions can be great, give it an interesting theme and start posting images.</li>

</ul>

<br>
<h2>4. Curate Third Party Review Sites</h2>
<br>

<p>Getting your website to the top ranking of a search term like &ldquo;Restaurants near me&rdquo; will be very hard. You can do the next best thing, or possibly even a better thing, by ranking highly on a recommendation site, in the UK it is most likely to be TripAdvisor. As mentioned in the consistency section above you now have this site fine tuned with great images content and information.</p>

<p>You should follow the same technique with reviews posted anywhere, you need to send happy customers to where they are most needed. For example you have spent the last month sending anyone that will comply to Google reviews, and the stars are looking great. You have neglected other sites at its benefit. At this stage you should be adjusting your strategies to promote any site that does not accurately represent your quality. Having one site at 3 stars, and the rest at 5 may look suspicious to a customer.</p>

<br>
<h2>5. Create an Email List</h2>
<br>

<p>Beyond all your social channels you may also have the opportunity to collect email addresses from your customers. This may be from a feedback form, online form, or gated access to your WIFI. Take the opportunity to engage with them too, you should be creating a summary of the posts you have made on social and compressing it into a monthly newsletter. You may want to highlight more offers and events in these emails as a highlight of the benefit to the receiver.</p>

<br>
<h2>6. Reach out to Influencers and Bloggers</h2>
<br>

<p>Keep an eye out for influence and bloggers in your local area, or even travelers passing through. You may be asked if they can visit and benefit from a free meal, take a serious look at the persons following, and make a judgement call on the value to you. If you think they have enough relevant followers that you can gain from them then make their experience a great one and reap the rewards.</p>

<p>Influncers may be more likely to send a sharp quick boost to your sales for a day or two as their media is usually a social post or video. This is great but the benefit will be short lived, when compared to a well known local review website or blog. If they write a post on your restaurant that has glowing reviews you may benefit from that one post for years. The opposite is also true, a bad review will be nearly impossible to shake off again if on a prominent site.</p>

<br>
<h2>7. Network With Other Local Businesses</h2>
<br>

<p>Great a reprotar with other local businesses like butchers and suppliers and share their content and promote their produce in your channels. Supplementary companies like this can really help boost followings on social media. Use their produce and your recipes and share pictures of the results, it's sure to get shared by them and appreciated by their fans and yours.</p>
